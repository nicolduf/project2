## Unreleased Harry Potter Movies 

[Unreleased Harry Potter Movies] (https://harrypotterunreleasedmovies.netlify.app/AllMoviesPage)
This project was made by Jos Bakker and Nicole Duffy

## Description

A fun, light-hearted app to show you the unreleased Harry Potter movies you never knew existed. It offers the feature to add and edit your own movies - with ratings, reviews, and descriptions.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP of this project includes the following users features:
1. **Home Page**: A welcome page that links to the All Movies Page, where the user can see the whole collection, and the Create New Movie Page.

2. **Data Managment**: The user can create, update and delete the movie's of their choice, which will be updated and presented on the All Movies Page.

## Backlog

1. In the future more styling will be applied throughout the whole app.
2. Search bar will be implemented, to search your favourite unreleased Harry Potter movie.
3. Social media channels will be developed and links will be added to the site.
